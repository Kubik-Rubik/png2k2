PNG to K2
==========

## What this plugin does
This plugin stops the automatic convertig from K2 images tab from png/gif in jpg

So you can use this plugin, if you need PNG/GIF images support in K2

## What the actual Problem is

This plugin was written from tthe guys arround joomlachamp.com. But it's no longer supported in K2 Version 2.7.0 and above. 

The current Version 1.0.5 is not compatible with PHP 7.0

##What is my goal for this Code Repo

So I search someone who can make this plugin running and compliant with PHP 7.x and K2 2.7.x
